## Tech Used and Why

- **ReactJS**: Chosen for its speed and efficiency, ReactJS uses a virtual DOM to minimize updates and enhance performance.
- **Vite**: Preferred over "Create React App" for its faster local development server and quicker server loading times.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for its utility-first approach, Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development with its shorthand CSS classes directly in HTML elements.
- **Framer Motion**: This animation library for ReactJS is used to create subtle and engaging animations throughout the portfolio.
- **Web3Forms**: A freemium contact form API that enables form submissions to be sent directly to an email without a backend. It is fast, efficient, and well-documented for easy integration.
